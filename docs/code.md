This code renders as a block on GitHub.com and also on GH Pages and has syntax highlighting on both.

```js
// a code comment
var declareAVariable = document.getElementById('anElement');
// check a condition
if (declareAVariable == 'kramdown') {
    // Give up all hope
    window.close();
}
```

1. First Item. This produces an indented codeblock with syntax highlighting on GitHub.com

 ```js
 // a code comment
 var declareAVariable = document.getElementById('anElement');
 // check a condition
 if (declareAVariable == 'kramdown') {
     // Give up all hope
     window.close();
 }
 ```

 * Sub-Item of First Item. This is a bullet point next to the code block, also indented.

1. Second Item. This starts with the number 2 on GitHub.com.

## Can I get a live preview page to show how the markdown will be rendered on GH Pages, with stupid Jekyll and kramdown or whatever?

### Or better yet, can we just get GH Pages to use freaking GitHub flavor markdown.

#### Or at the very least make it so after I save and go back to see how Jekyll has mangled my markdown, can we get the page to update in under 5 minutes?
