# The Three Types of Projects you can work on

Picking one and sticking to it will allow you to actually finish your projects and understand what you want out of them.

1. Academic
1. Résumé
1. Passion

Each of these varies in how long they take, and what their primary purpose is. **You cannot do a project that combines these without failing.** You *can* however convert one into another, though without clear understanding of the purpose of each, this tactic will also fail.



## Academic Project

Academeic projects are ones in which the sole purpose of them is to **learn something new**. This is about gaining experience with something you are interested in, but know little about. Finishing an academic project is completely optional. The point is **not** to make something cool, or to make sure it gets finished. In fact, you will almost never finish an academic project. It's to experiment and learn by failure. **These are *disposable* projects**. By their very nature, these should be the least polished of the types of projects you create, because they are not meant to be shown off, and in almost all cases you will not finish the project anyway. These can be short one-day projects, or up to a month or two of experimenting. But they should **not** go on longer than that, or you will be running into *Passion Project* territory, and the two cannot begin from the same starting point.


## Résumé Project

These are meant to be shown off on your résumé under a section called "Other Experience". These show potential employers that you are passionate about what you do and about learning. They also show you are original, as they concepts for these projects should be novel. Whatever type of project you are trying to do, there will be others doing similar projects. If you are just trying to learn something new, you can repeat the same tutorial or recreate the same basic project you've seen others do a thousand times. **No employer is impressed** by seeing "yet another XYZ project", they've seen those before. It just shows that you can follow a tutorial.

For a résumé project, your goal is to create something interesting and novel. It should be a concept that has not been done a thousand times before. You should spend approximately 2 weeks building a demo/proof of concept, and then 1 week polishing it. It doesn't need to be a finished, scalable project that could be turned into a business tomorrow, it just needs to be functional, limited in scope, and polished. It should *look* finished. You are permitted to use **one** new technology in a résumé project, **if** the company you are applying for uses that technology. Any more new stuff will slow you down and make you take longer to complete the project than your 2 week deadline.


## Passion Project

Passion projects are ones that you *have* to complete. There is something about this thing you are going to make that you **need** to have exist. These projects are ones where you are in it for the long haul. You are willing to spend a year or more working on it. Your goal, above all else, is to get the thing **done**. You **need** to finish it. By this very nature, you should **avoid** learning new things. Only learn something new if there is no other way to continue forward. Make sure to scope your project into phases so you know what the bare minimum is required to get it to a "done" state. And move everything else to Phase 2 or Phase 3. Passion can fade, so these phases give you time to stop and reevaluate. "Phase 1 is complete, am I happy with this? Can I live with the project staying like this forever?" If the answer is "Yes", then congratulations, you finished a project and avoided feature creep. If the answer is "No", then congratulations, you have a first version you can keep as a reference to see how far you've come when you complete future versions. And you have something people can start trying out and giving you feedback on as you work on the next phase.



## TLDR (In summary)

1. **Academic** - Purely to learn something new. Don't focus on finishing the project. Don't use up your cool ideas on this, save them for Résumé projects. **1-60 days**
1. **Résumé** - Cool/novel ideas. Proof of concept. Very polished. Avoid new technologies, they will slow you down, only allow yourself one new technology if it is used by the company you are applying for. **2 weeks creating, 1 week polishing**
1. **Passion** - The projects you absolutely must see to completion. Avoid new technologies at all costs, each new technology increases the risk of not being able to complete your project. "Your pencils are sharp enough, even the dull ones will make a mark". **As long as it takes** (though you should scope it to have checkpoints where it is functionally completed, but not necessarily your final version).



## ***BONUS!*** Converting from one project type to another

Attempting to convert from one type of project to another can be fraught with disaster, and often fails. Here are some tips to help you be more successfull at the attempt (Note: **you will probably fail though**).

* **Academic to Résumé** - These two are tough, they are complete opposites. Academic is all about boring topics, learning, not finishing, and no polish. Résumé is all about novel topics, finishing a demo, avoiding new technology, and lots of polish. Your best bet is to come up with a novel or interesting concept, and start over from scratch using the new information you've learned while making your academic project. If you try to refactor your existing academic project it will be a mess. Spend the time to start over with the new knowledge you've learned.
* **Academic to Passion** - You've just spent a few weeks or months learning something new, and now you want to use what you've learned on a new passion project. Can you reuse what you've already create? No. No you cannot. Academic projects are disposable. Accept that and start again from scratch on your passion project. While learning, you make a lot of mistakes and build very messy stuff. Going back and refactoring what you've made to be cleaner is good if you need a better understanding of how to architect a project using the new technology you've learned, but again, that is a learning experience, and therefore should not be part of a passion project. Passion projects are all about using what you already know and avoiding learning new things, as they are distractions that will prevent you from finishing. Your best bet of success for a passion project getting finished, is to start it from scratch using what you've already learned from the academic project, but not building on top of the existing project, as it will be a mess.

* **Résumé to Academic** - You're two weeks are up, it's a functional demo. You spend a week polishing. Awesome! You're done! But what if you want to take this cool project and some new stuff to it that you want to learn. Well, go for it it! That's right, just make sure you have a nice, saved copy of it in it's initial finished state so you can still show that off. Once you've got that backed up, you can go wild with experimenting and trying new things. Keep in mind that you are starting from a demo/proof of concept, made in very little time, so you are building on top of some shaky ground. You most likely will not be showing off whatever you add to this Résumé turned Academic project. It's just good sometimes to experiment on top of an existing project, rather than having to reinvent the wheel just to learn something new.
* **Résumé to Passion** - In most cases, Résumé projects aren't build on solid enough ground to really build directly on top of, since they just need to be good enough for a demo/proof of concept. So be sure to look at the existing architecture of your Résumé project before you turn it into a Passion project. But of all the Project to Project conversions, this is the most natural. If you think the structure of your Résumé project is solid and worth building on top of, then scope out what needs to be done to make it a fully functional finished project, and not just a demo. Then split that functionality out into phases so you can have time to reevaluate after each phase to see if you should still keep going. If your initial Résumé project's structue isn't good enough to scale to the larger scope of a Passion project, then don't be afraid to start over. Some of your work can be recycled, but you will be much better off. You are not throwing away 3 weeks of work, you are saving yourself months of work of trying to correct from a bad start on a long term project. 3 weeks isn't much on something you plan to spend 6-18 months on. Typically the most valuable part of the Résumé project is the novel idea anyway. So don't be afraid to throw away everything else and just keep the novel idea.

* **Passion to Résumé** - This one is fairly natural too. If you can get your Passion project to a stable state where you've completed at least one of the phases for it, then speend a week really polishing it and use *that* as a résumé project. The size and scale of your project will be the impressive part, and the fact that you can finish projects says **a lot** to employers.
* **Passion to Academic** - Don't do it. Alright, if you **must**. Then create a seperate, disposable, copy for the academic project. Academic projects are purely for learning. The only reason you should branch off of a Passion project for the purpose of an Academic project, is if you are needing that existing foundation to be able to explore and learn the new things, and it's faster to use what you already have, than it is to recreate a new foundation. But beware... the primary rule of a Passion project is to **avoid** learning new things, they are a distraction and will prevent you from finishing your passion project.
