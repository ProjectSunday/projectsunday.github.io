# Getting Started in Web Dev

These are the top items to look in to if you are interested in getting started in Web Development (mostly front-end).

This page is meant to be a resource of the **most common** things I end up linking to people as they are learning web dev. It should be short so it doesn't overwhelm people.

1. **[JSFiddle](http://JSFiddle.net)** - Use this when you are having trouble getting code to work and need help from someone
